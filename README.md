## What is it?

VUTE is a complex text encoding that is designed to be the most optimal for
the most common use cases. It is designed to be a simple, fast, and
efficient text encoding that is easy to use and understand.

## Why is it better than other encodings?

- *VUTE* takes less space than other encodings, because uses variable code pages (VCPs) isntead of escaping and surrogate pairs.
- *VUTE* is faster than other encodings, because codec haven't to parse complex escape sequences.
- *VUTE* is compatible with ASCII, and it almost compatible with cpXXXX encodings, if uses only one VCP.
